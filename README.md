# An Introduction to R and FAQ for Planners

For years, I've been teaching data analysis, statistical modeling, and spatial analysis using the software language R, and it's always a challenge to get students started with some basics, so that we can move quickly to applied methods and concepts.

This is a working document designed to give a basic introduction to R and compile frequently asked questions that come up in class. It will be updated on an ongoing basis, and might look like a total construction site at times.
